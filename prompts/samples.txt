I want to access the tables in the Log Analytics Workspace I hold on 
Azure through a .NET Core console application. 
What kind of configuration do I need to do on the Azure portal for this?

###

Add the following NuGet packages to your .NET Core console application:

- Microsoft.Azure.Kusto.Data
  C:\Users\barisu\.nuget\packages\microsoft.azure.kusto.data\12.2.3\readme.txt
